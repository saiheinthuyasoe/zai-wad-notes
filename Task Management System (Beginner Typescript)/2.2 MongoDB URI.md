# How to get **MongoDB URI**

You can obtain the **MongoDB URI** for your MongoDB Atlas cluster from the **MongoDB Atlas dashboard**. Hereâ€™s how you can find it:

### Steps to Get the MongoDB URI from MongoDB Atlas:

1. **Log in to MongoDB Atlas**:
   - Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com/) and sign in with your credentials.

2. **Access Your Cluster**:
   - Once you're logged in, click on the **"Clusters"** tab.
   - Select the cluster you want to connect to.

3. **Connect to Your Cluster**:
   - In the cluster overview, click the **"Connect"** button (usually found near the top right).

4. **Choose a Connection Method**:
   - Select **"Connect your application"** when prompted.

5. **Copy the Connection String**:
   - MongoDB Atlas will show a **connection string** in the following format:
     ```bash
     mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
     ```
   - Replace `<username>`, `<password>`, and `<dbname>` with your database details.

6. **Add IP Whitelist**:
   - If you haven't done so, MongoDB will prompt you to **add your IP address to the whitelist**. This allows you to connect from your local machine or server.
   
7. **Create a Database User**:
   - If you haven't already, you'll need to create a **MongoDB user** with the required permissions for your cluster. MongoDB will guide you through this when setting up the connection string.

Once you copy this URI, you can use it in your application by replacing the placeholders with your actual username, password, and database name.
