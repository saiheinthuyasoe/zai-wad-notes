# Testing with curl

To test your backend APIs using `curl`, follow the steps below. `curl` is a command-line tool to transfer data over various protocols, including HTTP, which is what we'll use to test the API.

### **Step 1: Start the Backend Server**

First, make sure your server is running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your server should be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

### **Step 2: Use `curl` to Test API Endpoints**

#### **1. Create a Task**

To create a new task using the `POST` method, use the following `curl` command:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/tasks \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "title": "Complete project setup",
  "description": "Set up the project and configure TypeScript",
  "status": "todo"
}'
```

**Explanation**:

- `-X POST`: Specifies that we're making a `POST` request.
- `-H "Content-Type: application/json"`: Sets the content type to JSON.
- `-d '{...}'`: The request body (data) being sent as JSON.

**Expected Response**:

```json
{
  "_id": "task_id",
  "title": "Complete project setup",
  "description": "Set up the project and configure TypeScript",
  "status": "todo",
  "assignee": null,
  "__v": 0
}
```

---

#### **2. Get All Tasks**

To fetch all tasks using the `GET` method, use this command:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/tasks
```

**Expected Response**:

```json
[
  {
    "_id": "task_id",
    "title": "Complete project setup",
    "description": "Set up the project and configure TypeScript",
    "status": "todo",
    "assignee": null,
    "__v": 0
  }
]
```

---

#### **3. Update a Task**

To update a specific task using the `PUT` method, you need the task ID. Replace `<task_id>` with the actual task `_id` you received in the previous response:

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:5000/api/tasks/<task_id> \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "title": "Update project setup",
  "description": "Updated task description",
  "status": "in-progress"
}'
```

**Expected Response**:

```json
{
  "_id": "task_id",
  "title": "Update project setup",
  "description": "Updated task description",
  "status": "in-progress",
  "assignee": null,
  "__v": 0
}
```

---

#### **4. Delete a Task**

To delete a specific task using the `DELETE` method, replace `<task_id>` with the actual task `_id`:

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5000/api/tasks/<task_id>
```

**Expected Response**:
You should receive a 204 response with no body, indicating that the task has been successfully deleted.

---

### **Additional Options for `curl`**

- **View Response Headers**: Add the `-i` flag to include response headers in the output.

  ```bash
  curl -i http://localhost:5000/api/tasks
  ```

- **Verbose Output**: Add the `-v` flag for verbose output, which will give you detailed information about the request.

  ```bash
  curl -v http://localhost:5000/api/tasks
  ```

- **Save Response to File**: Add the `-o` flag to save the response to a file.
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:5000/api/tasks -o response.json
  ```
