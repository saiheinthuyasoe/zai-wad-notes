# How to use Postman?

To check your Express CRUD API with Postman, follow these steps:

### 1. Start Your Server

Make sure you have your server running. If you haven't already, compile and run the TypeScript code:

```bash
npm  run build
npm run start
```

You should see something like:

```
Server is running on port 5000
```

### 2. Set Up Postman

#### Step 1: Open Postman

If you donâ€™t have Postman installed, you can download it [here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

#### Step 2: Testing API Endpoints

1. **GET all customers:**

   - **Method:** `GET`
   - **URL:** `http://localhost:5000/api/customers`
   - **Response:** You should see the list of customers in JSON format.

   Example response:

   ```json
   [
     { "id": 1, "name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com" },
     { "id": 2, "name": "Jane Smith", "email": "jane@example.com" }
   ]
   ```

2. **GET customer by ID:**

   - **Method:** `GET`
   - **URL:** `http://localhost:5000/api/customers/1`
   - **Response:** You should get the customer with ID `1`.

   Example response:

   ```json
   { "id": 1, "name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com" }
   ```

3. **POST (Create) a new customer:**

   - **Method:** `POST`
   - **URL:** `http://localhost:5000/api/customers`
   - **Body:** Select `raw` in Postman and set the body format to `JSON`. Enter the following data:

     ```json
     {
       "name": "New Customer",
       "email": "newcustomer@example.com"
     }
     ```

   - **Response:** A new customer will be created, and you should receive the newly created customer in the response.

   Example response:

   ```json
   {
     "id": 3,
     "name": "New Customer",
     "email": "newcustomer@example.com"
   }
   ```

4. **PUT (Update) an existing customer:**

   - **Method:** `PUT`
   - **URL:** `http://localhost:5000/api/customers/1`
   - **Body:** Select `raw` in Postman and set the body format to `JSON`. Enter the updated data:

     ```json
     {
       "name": "Updated Name",
       "email": "updated@example.com"
     }
     ```

   - **Response:** The customer with ID `1` will be updated, and you should get the updated customer data.

   Example response:

   ```json
   {
     "id": 1,
     "name": "Updated Name",
     "email": "updated@example.com"
   }
   ```

5. **DELETE an existing customer:**

   - **Method:** `DELETE`
   - **URL:** `http://localhost:5000/api/customers/1`
   - **Response:** The customer with ID `1` will be deleted, and you should get a `204 No Content` response.

### Common Postman Errors

- **404 Not Found:** Make sure the server is running, and the URL is correct (check if the `/api/customers` route is correctly set up).
- **500 Internal Server Error:** This could happen if the server throws an unhandled error. Check your server logs to see what's wrong.

If everything is configured correctly, you should now be able to test all CRUD operations using Postman. Let me know if you run into any issues!
