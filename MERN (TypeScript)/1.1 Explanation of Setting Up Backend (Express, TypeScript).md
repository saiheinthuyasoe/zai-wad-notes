# Explanation of Setting up Backend

## Difference between "dependencies" and "devDependencies" in the package.json

### dependencies

1.  These are the packages that your project requires to run in production.
2.  These packages are essential for the app to function correctly when deployed.
3.  When you run npm install (or pnpm install or yarn install), these dependencies are installed both in development and production environments.

### devDependencies

1.  These are the packages that are only required during the development process and not needed in production.
2.  These are typically tools for testing, building, or linting your code, such as compilers (like Babel), linters (like ESLint), or testing frameworks (like Jest).
3.  When deploying your app in a production environment, you typically don't need these, and you can avoid installing them with (npm install --production).

## Explaination of "script"

### Here's a breakdown of the three commands in your package.json:

**"dev": "tsnd --respawn -r tsconfig-paths/register --pretty --transpile-only ./src/index.ts":**

**tsnd:** Short for ts-node-dev, this runs the TypeScript file without compiling it, and watches for file changes.
**--respawn:** Automatically restarts the server when any changes are detected in the TypeScript files.
**-r tsconfig-paths/register:** Registers tsconfig-paths to resolve any custom path aliases youâ€™ve set in your tsconfig.json.
**--pretty:** Enables colorful and formatted output in the terminal.
**--transpile-only:** Skips full type checking to speed up the process, only transpiling the TypeScript to JavaScript.
**./src/index.ts:** This points to the entry file (index.ts) in your src folder that the script will run.
**In short, this command runs your project in development mode with fast compilation, file-watching, and path alias support.**

**"build": "tsc && tsc-alias":**

**tsc:** This runs the TypeScript compiler (tsc), which converts your TypeScript files into JavaScript and places them in the dist folder (or wherever you've configured the output).
**&&:** Ensures that the next command (tsc-alias) runs only if tsc succeeds.
**tsc-alias:** This replaces any path aliases defined in your tsconfig.json with the actual paths in the compiled JavaScript files. This ensures the compiled JavaScript code uses correct file paths.
**In short, this builds your TypeScript project and adjusts any path aliases in the output.**

**"start": "node ./dist":**

**node ./dist:** This runs your compiled JavaScript project from the dist folder using Node.js. It assumes your project's entry point is in ./dist/index.js or the equivalent file after compilation.
**In short, this command starts the production-ready, compiled JavaScript code using Node.js.**

## "src/index.ts" in Express.js

In an Express project, the src/index.ts file is typically the main entry point for your TypeScript server application. This file is where you initialize and configure the Express app.

## ".gitignore" file

A **.gitignore** file is used in Git to specify which files or directories should be ignored by version control. This means Git will not track changes to the files listed in the .gitignore file, keeping your repository clean from unnecessary or sensitive files.

**Example of .gitignore file for Node.js Project**

**bash**

```
*# Ignore node_modules folder*
node_modules/

*# Ignore dist folder where compiled files go*
dist/

*# Ignore environment files*
.env

*# Ignore logs*
logs/
*.log

*# Ignore TypeScript build artifacts*
*.tsbuildinfo

```
