# How to use curl?

To check your API using `curl`, hereâ€™s how you can test the CRUD operations. Make sure your server is running first:

```bash
npm run start
```

### 1. **GET all customers**

This command fetches all customers from your API.

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/customers
```

Expected response (if customers exist):

```json
[
  { "id": 1, "name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com" },
  { "id": 2, "name": "Jane Smith", "email": "jane@example.com" }
]
```

### 2. **GET a customer by ID**

To fetch a single customer by their ID (in this case, ID = 1):

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/customers/1
```

Expected response:

```json
{ "id": 1, "name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com" }
```

### 3. **POST (Create) a new customer**

This command creates a new customer. You can use `-X POST` to specify the HTTP method, and `-d` to pass the data as JSON:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/customers \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"name": "New Customer", "email": "newcustomer@example.com"}'
```

Expected response (201 Created):

```json
{
  "id": 3,
  "name": "New Customer",
  "email": "newcustomer@example.com"
}
```

### 4. **PUT (Update) a customer**

This command updates an existing customer by ID. You need to pass the new data in the request body:

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:5000/api/customers/1 \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"name": "Updated Name", "email": "updated@example.com"}'
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Updated Name",
  "email": "updated@example.com"
}
```

### 5. **DELETE a customer**

This command deletes a customer by ID (e.g., ID = 1):

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5000/api/customers/1
```

Expected response (204 No Content):

```bash
(no content in response)
```

### Summary of Commands:

   `curl http://localhost:5000/api/customers`

2. **Get a customer by ID:**

4. **Update a customer by ID:**  
   `curl -X PUT http://localhost:5000/api/customers/1 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Updated Name", "email": "updated@example.com"}'`
