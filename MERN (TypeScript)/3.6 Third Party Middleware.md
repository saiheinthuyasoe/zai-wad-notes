# Third Party Middleware

Third-party middleware refers to middleware that is created by someone else (often a package or library) and is not part of the core Express framework. These middleware functions are designed to handle common tasks or enhance the functionality of an Express app, and they can be easily integrated by installing the relevant npm packages.

Here are some common third-party middleware examples:

### 1. **`morgan` (HTTP request logger)**

Morgan is a popular middleware used to log HTTP requests in an Express application. It provides useful logging during development and debugging.

**Installation**:

```bash
npm install morgan
```

**Usage**:

```javascript
const morgan = require("morgan");
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

// Use morgan to log requests to the console
app.use(morgan("dev"));

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello, World!");
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server running on port 3000");
});
```

### 2. **`body-parser` (Request body parsing)**

This middleware is used to parse incoming request bodies before your handlers. While it's now included in Express itself (`express.json()` and `express.urlencoded()`), the `body-parser` package is still useful for more complex scenarios.

**Installation**:

```bash
npm install body-parser
```

**Usage**:

```javascript
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

// Parse JSON bodies
app.use(bodyParser.json());

app.post("/data", (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.body); // The parsed body of the POST request
  res.send("Data received");
});

app.listen(3000);
```

### 3. **`cookie-parser` (Cookie handling)**

Cookie-parser is used to parse cookies attached to client requests. It allows you to easily retrieve cookies from the `req.cookies` object.

**Installation**:

```bash
npm install cookie-parser
```

**Usage**:

```javascript
const cookieParser = require("cookie-parser");
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

// Use cookie-parser middleware
app.use(cookieParser());

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  // Access cookies using req.cookies
  console.log(req.cookies);
  res.send("Cookies logged!");
});

app.listen(3000);
```

### 4. **`cors` (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**

`cors` is a middleware that enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. It allows your server to accept requests from other domains, which is necessary in cases where your frontend and backend are hosted on different domains or ports.

**Installation**:

```bash
npm install cors
```

**Usage**:

```javascript
const cors = require("cors");
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

// Use CORS middleware
app.use(cors());

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("CORS enabled");
});

app.listen(3000);
```

### 5. **`helmet` (Security middleware)**

Helmet is a middleware that helps secure your Express apps by setting various HTTP headers to protect against common vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) and clickjacking.

**Installation**:

```bash
npm install helmet
```

**Usage**:

```javascript
const helmet = require("helmet");
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

// Use helmet for securing HTTP headers
app.use(helmet());

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Helmet is securing headers");
});

app.listen(3000);
```

### 6. **`express-session` (Session management)**

`express-session` provides session management functionality, which allows you to store data across multiple requests from the same client (e.g., user login sessions).

**Installation**:

```bash
npm install express-session
```

**Usage**:

```javascript
const session = require("express-session");
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

// Use express-session for session management
app.use(
  session({
    secret: "your-secret-key",
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: true,
  })
);

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  // Example of session usage
  req.session.user = "John Doe";
  res.send("Session set for user");
});

app.listen(3000);
```

### 7. **`compression` (Response compression)**

`compression` middleware compresses the response sent to the client, which can reduce the size of the response body and improve performance, especially for larger payloads.

**Installation**:

```bash
npm install compression
```

**Usage**:

```javascript
const compression = require("compression");
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

// Use compression middleware
app.use(compression());

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Response compressed");
});

app.listen(3000);
```

### 8. **`multer` (File uploads)**

`multer` is a middleware for handling multipart/form-data, which is used for uploading files in an Express app.

**Installation**:

```bash
npm install multer
```

**Usage**:

```javascript
const multer = require("multer");
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

// Set up multer for file uploads
const upload = multer({ dest: "uploads/" });

app.post("/upload", upload.single("file"), (req, res) => {
  res.send("File uploaded");
});

app.listen(3000);
```

### 9. **`passport` (Authentication middleware)**

`passport` is a popular middleware for handling authentication in Express applications. It supports strategies for authentication like local authentication, OAuth, and many others.

**Installation**:

```bash
npm install passport
```

**Usage**:

```javascript
const passport = require("passport");
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.use(passport.initialize());

app.get("/auth", passport.authenticate("strategy-name"));

app.listen(3000);
```

### 10. **`rate-limiter-flexible` (Rate Limiting)**

This middleware helps prevent abuse by limiting the number of requests a user can make over a certain time period.

**Installation**:

```bash
npm install rate-limiter-flexible
```

**Usage**:

```javascript
const { RateLimiterMemory } = require("rate-limiter-flexible");
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

const rateLimiter = new RateLimiterMemory({
  points: 10, // 10 requests
  duration: 1, // Per second
});

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  rateLimiter
    .consume(req.ip)
    .then(() => {
      next();
    })
    .catch(() => {
      res.status(429).send("Too many requests");
    });
});

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Rate limiting example");
});

app.listen(3000);
```

### Conclusion:

Third-party middleware in Express helps simplify common tasks like logging, request body parsing, file uploads, authentication, security, and performance optimization. You can find a wide range of middleware for specific needs on npm and integrate them into your Express apps to handle specific functionality.
